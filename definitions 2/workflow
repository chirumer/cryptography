Create a markdown file that displays all the images in equations_svg folder

Also, for each image, map it to one of the latex files in attack_gain_equations, equations, rapor_slide_eqns.
Include the latex in the readme

The equations are from @attacks.pdf @LDP_Freq_Est.pdf @rappor.pdf 

For each equation, write brief description of the terms in latex (one term per line) and add it to the folder descriptions_latex

Include these under the equation in the markdown file

Use @latex_to_svg.py to convert all these latex descriptions into svg at descriptions_svg

also display these description images under the corresponding equation in the markdown file.


Do careful analysis to avoid hallucinating term descriptions.

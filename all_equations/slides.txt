Outline
 Introduction:                            Frequency Estimation Techniques:
    • Differential Privacy                  • K Randomized Response (kRR)
    • Local Differential Privacy            • Optimized Unary Encoding (OUE)
    • Frequency Estimation and Pure LDP     • Optimized Local Hashing (OLH)
    • Attack Problem


 Attacks:                                 Defenses:
   • Attack Types                           • ?
   • Attacking kRR                          • ?
   • Attacking OUE                          • ?

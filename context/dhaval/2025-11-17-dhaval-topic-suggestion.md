# 2025-11-17 – Dhaval topic suggestion

## Candidate areas from conference/book table of contents

Dhaval shared a screenshot of a table of contents with the following cryptography-related sections and papers:

### Lattice-Based Zero Knowledge
- Lattice-Based Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Applications: Shorter, Simpler, and More General
- Lattice-Based SNARKs: Publicly Verifiable, Preprocessing, and Recursively Composable (Extended Abstract)
- Practical Sublinear Proofs for R1CS from Lattices

### Quantum Cryptography II
- On the Impossibility of Key Agreements from Quantum Random Oracles
- Succinct Classical Verification of Quantum Computation
- On the Feasibility of Unclonable Encryption, and More

### Lattice-Based Signatures
- Shorter Hash-and-Sign Lattice-Based Signatures

## Dhaval’s proposal (from message)
- Suggests that we **pick one main topic** such as:
  - *Lattice-based zero knowledge*, or
  - *Quantum cryptography*.
- From that topic, **select 3 research papers** that are already listed in this conference/book table of contents.
- Notes that these papers are **readily available** (we can download the book / proceedings), so:
  - We **don’t need to search far and wide** for papers elsewhere.
  - We will already have **three concrete research papers** to read, review, and write a report on.
- Ends by asking the group for feedback: essentially, *“What do you guys think?”*

## Possible follow-up actions
- Decide which topic to prioritize (e.g., Lattice-based zero knowledge vs. quantum cryptography).
- From the chosen section, select **three specific papers** as the core reading/report set.
- Use these papers to define the project/report scope and work plan.

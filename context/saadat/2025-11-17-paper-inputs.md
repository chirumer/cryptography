# 2025-11-17 – Saadat inputs on papers

## Hyperparameter Tuning With Rényi Differential Privacy (ML paper)
- Very difficult to follow; derivations are highly complex.
- Uses Rényi Differential Privacy and Rényi divergence instead of standard (ε, δ)-DP.
- Saadat’s impression: this line of work may be too technically heavy for us to pursue right now; likely better not to base our project on this.

## Data Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy Protocols (Security paper)
- Comparatively easier to follow, but still dense.
- Consistent with many USENIX papers: long and dense but more accessible than the above ML paper.
- Because it is easier to follow, Saadat feels this is a more promising direction for us to take.

## Next steps
- Discuss in the next meeting and decide whether to focus on the data poisoning attacks to LDP protocols line of work going forward.
